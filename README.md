### Advice for learning pytorch from my point of view
1. If you are new to Pytorch, start with [sebastianraschka's blog](https://sebastianraschka.com/teaching/pytorch-1h/) first. It gives a well-structured overview of Pytorch basics. Don't worry too much about the details -- try running the sample code yourself to reinforce understanding and memory.

2. Watch [Liuerdaren 's video tutorial on BiliBili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Y7411d7Ys?spm_id_from=333.788.videopod.episodes&vd_source=add97f0fa76c8802572cfe083bdc2765/) to gain a deeper, more practical understanding of Pytorch from an engineering perspective. Gradually, try to build you own model training frameword.

3. Based on your research topic or project, read relevent reference books and papers, and tyring using PyTorch to complete your own scientific or engineering tasks.

4. Whenever you run into problems, feel free to ask ChatGPT or other large language models for help.
